        <p>A game that I have made on my own is One Night at Martinez (that is the actual name I'm not joking). In that game, your goal is to survive until 6 AM in an office with limited power.</p>
        <p>The game requires you to close the doors in the office in order to survive, otherwise you get caught and lose. You have a camera system as well that you can use.</p>
